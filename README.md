## DNA-KNN_Implementation_PythonExample
Implementation of K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with an open source dataset using Python from scratch

## Creating KNN from scratch
1.) Calculate the distance of new point from other data pointds in training data
2.) Sort the values based on the distance in ascending order
3.) Get the K nearest neighbours
4.) choose the maximum labels out of k nearest neighbours
